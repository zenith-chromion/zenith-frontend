  App.css
  This file is intentionally left minimal as Tailwind CSS handles most of the styling.
  Any global or override styles specific to the App component (if not handled by Tailwind)
  could be placed here.

/* Example: If you had a custom font that Tailwind couldn't load or if you wanted a very specific global reset */

/*
  Since Tailwind CSS is loaded via CDN with custom config directly in App.jsx,
  most styles are applied via utility classes in JSX.
  If you were using Tailwind via a build process (e.g., PostCSS), this file might
  contain @tailwind directives.
